Note: 
If any of youre files are missing when trying to commit or sync the problem may be that the file you are trying to commit/sync is using a file extension which is being ignore using githubs .gitignore file. You may edit the .gitignore file yourself and add a commit saying "removed <insert file extension name here> from .gitignore to allow <insert file name here> to sync". Other unwanted files with the same file extension may pop up when their file extension was removed from the .gitignore file. Right click and select "ignore file" for each one. 

If any updates are made to the README.md (this file) then title the commit as README to make sure other contributors read your updates, it is important that whenever an update is made to the README.md that every contributor reads it
